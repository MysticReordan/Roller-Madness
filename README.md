# Roller-Madness
A basic 3D game, built on Unity 3D and scripted in C#, Roller Madness primarily comprises two levels with a user-friendly UI and is developed as part of a Coursera course conducted by Michigan State University.
The coding of the scripts in this project was done in C# language on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, aided by the Unity Scripting Reference as well as the Microsoft Azure .NET Coding  Reference.  The game is built on the Unity 3D platform developed by Unity Technologies and employs the movement of a spherical ball along a rectangular platform while avoiding obstacles and using planks and inclined planes to collect coins to increase the scores. A RigidBody and BoxCollider helped in the bouncing off the physics material on the obstacles amidst a proper skybox material.
